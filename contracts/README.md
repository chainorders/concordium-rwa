### [Security Token Contract](./security-nft/src/lib.rs) : `rwa_security_nft` CIS2 compatible contract for security NFTs

The `Security Token Contract` is a robust and flexible solution for managing security Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). It provides a comprehensive set of functionalities for managing the lifecycle of these tokens.

Key functionalities include:

- **Agent Management**: Functions like `addAgent` and `removeAgent` allow for the addition and removal of agents, who are authorized to perform certain actions within the contract. The `agents` function retrieves the list of agents.
- **Token Management**: The contract supports the creation (`mint`), destruction (`burn`), and transfer (`transfer`, `forcedTransfer`) of tokens. It also allows for the freezing (`freeze`, `unFreeze`) and pausing (`pause`, `unPause`) of token operations.
- **Balance Queries**: Functions like `balanceOf`, `balanceOfFrozen`, and `balanceOfUnFrozen` provide the ability to query the total, frozen, and unfrozen balance of tokens for a specific holder.
- **Compliance and Identity Registry**: The `compliance` and `identityRegistry` functions return the contract addresses of the associated compliance contract and identity registry, respectively. These can be updated using `setCompliance` and `setIdentityRegistry`.
- **Recovery**: The `recover` function provides a mechanism to recover a lost account.
- **Interface Support Check**: The `supports` function allows the contract to check if it implements a specific interface.
- **Token Metadata**: The `tokenMetadata` function provides detailed information about a specific token.

### [Identity Registry Contract](./identity-registry/src/lib.rs) : `rwa_identity_registry`

The `Identity Registry Contract` is a comprehensive solution for managing identities within a contract. It provides a wide range of functionalities for managing the lifecycle of identities.

Key functionalities include:

- **Agent Management**: Functions like `addAgent` and `removeAgent` allow for the addition and removal of agents, who are authorized to perform certain actions within the contract. The `agents` function retrieves the list of agents.
- **Issuer Management**: Functions like `addIssuer` and `removeIssuer` allow for the addition and removal of issuers, who are authorized to issue identities. The `issuers` function retrieves the list of issuers.
- **Identity Management**: The contract supports the registration (`registerIdentities`), deletion (`deleteIdentities`), and updating (`updateIdentities`) of identities. It also allows for the fetching of identity details (`getIdentity`) and checking if a holder has an identity (`hasIdentity`).
- **Identity Verification**: The `isVerified` function checks if an identity is verified.
- **Interface Support Check**: The `supports` function allows the contract to check if it implements a specific interface.
